# Traffic Light Controller (FSM-based)

## 📝 Description
This is a finite state machine (FSM) implementation of a traffic light controller in Verilog. It cycles through Red → Green → Yellow based on clock cycles.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
- FSM modeling in Verilog
- State transitions
- Output encoding and sequencing

## 🔧 Files
- `traffic_light_controller.v` – FSM RTL code
- `traffic_light_controller_tb.v` – Testbench

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- ModelSim / QuestaSim
- EDA Playground
- Icarus Verilog / GTKWave

## 📗 How to Run
1. Compile the RTL and testbench
2. Run the simulation
3. Observe the light outputs (`lights[2:0]`) cycling through Red, Green, Yellow
